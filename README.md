# Alejandro Danús 🌐

Hello, world! 👋 I'm Alejandro - a seasoned finance professional, entrepreneur, and now delving deep into the realms of big data.

## 📜 Bio

With a rich 7-year background in finance and entrepreneurship, I'm known to be a **motivated team player**. I've showcased leadership in sectors like Real Estate and Retail. My entrepreneurial zeal has seen the launch of 4 sustainable projects, amassing over 50 clients within their first year.

Living and studying in Chile, Brazil, and Spain has not only enriched my cultural palette but has also honed my communication and language skills.

Recently, I embarked on a journey in data science. I'm currently pursuing an MBA and a Master's in Big Data from IE School, Madrid. Not just in theory, I've also put my data skills to test in my first Datathon!
